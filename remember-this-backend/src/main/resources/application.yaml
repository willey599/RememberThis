# Note: The redirect-uri below is often managed differently in YAML for OAuth2 clients.
# While you can put it directly here, Spring Security often constructs it.
# However, if you explicitly need to define it this way for your setup, here it is.
# If it's for `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.redirect-uri`,
# it should be nested under `google`.
# I'm assuming you want it at the root level for now, as it was in .properties,
# but verify if it needs to be nested under `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.`
# for your specific Spring Security version and setup.
# If it needs to be under google, it would look like this:
#             redirect-uri: http://localhost:4200/login/oauth2/code/google
redirect-uri: http://localhost:4200/login/oauth2/code/google
