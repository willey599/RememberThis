This is a small CLI game called "Typing Hero" That I made for a java intro course.
To play, download the Playground package and run the program in your IDE of choice. 

The program tasks you with typing a certain set of attack commands as fast as you can, with the goal of dropping the boss monster's HP to zero. 
the game itself is nothing special, but it was my first step into creating classes and getters/setters.
